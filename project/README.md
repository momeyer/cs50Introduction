# Puzzle Game - Can you help Tonny?

The inspiration for this game came from a challenge that I had as a test to become a student at Codam Coding College (the original game is called RoboZZle).
I really loved the idea of designing a game to help people learn how functions work, and I though that adding some graphics would be interesting and much more intuitive, specially for kids.

"Can you help Tonny" contains 10 levels, they start very easy and the difficulty level increases bit by bit, so the user can understand how each action works.
